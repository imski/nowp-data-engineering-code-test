Several tables need little explanation

programmes : store different programmes
modules : store module details
instructors : store intructor details
students : store student details

The following probable a bit more:
module_instructors: for a given academic year, provide an instructor for a module
academic_offer: list the programmes offered for a given acedemic year and the modules it's composed of.
   A module could appear across several programmes but the students from different programmes would attend the same lectures for the module. 
student_enrollement: a student can enroll for a 1 programme per academic Year, hence a composed key on acYear and student_id   
    This allows storage of all students across acedemic years.

The relationships allow fetching the instructor for a given module in any given academic year.
Or fetching modules taught by a given instructor and the years that instructor taught them.
Which allows to find students enrolled in programmes that had those modules in those years.
You can find Students that took that module as it is part of the programme they enrolled in that academic year or any year on record.
